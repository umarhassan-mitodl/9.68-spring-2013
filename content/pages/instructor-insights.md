## Course Overview

This page focuses on the course _9.68 Affect: Neurobiological, Psychological, and Sociocultural Counterparts of “Feelings”_ as it was taught by Professor Stephan L. Chorover in Spring 2013.

This course studied the relations of affect to cognition and behavior, feeling to thinking and acting, and values to beliefs and practices. These connections were considered at the psychological level of organization and in terms of their neurobiological and sociocultural counterparts. The course was organized into a collaborative learning system with weekly class sessions, small study groups and several field trips.
